## Improvements
- sanitize inputs
- extract magic strings
- add retry / timeout functionality
- better way to import folders and subfolders
- add CI/CD
- add static analysis tool and reporter
- enhance design: polymorphism / startegy pattern (as forwarding rules will grow in complexity), pub/sub pattern (keep track of / easily manage forwarding targets at runtime), adapter pattern (for the data transformations), etc
- add testing spies to remove / in addition to integration tests
